Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

    
    Loads the activity and feature data
    Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which denote a       mean or standard deviation
    Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the     dataset
    Merges the two datasets
    Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
    Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for every          subject and activity pair.

The end result is as shown in the file tidy.txt.
